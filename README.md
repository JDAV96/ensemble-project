# Ensemble Code Sample Project
- This is a code sample for a simple movie search app.
- After pulling the code you will have to create a file called "apiKeys.js" under the "src" folder that exports your api key.
- Here is a link to request an api key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
- Example code for apiKeys.js :

```
const omdbApiKey = "[YOUR API KEY HERE]";

export default omdbApiKey;
```
